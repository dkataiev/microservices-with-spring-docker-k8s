2. How to build production ready microservices using  Spring, SpringBoot and Spring Cloud 
3. What are cloud native apps & 12 factor principles behind them 
4. Configuration management in microservices using Spring Cloud Config Server 
5. Service Discovery and Registration pattern inside microservices and how to implement using Spring Eureka server 
6. Building resilient microservices using RESILIENCE4J framework 
7. Handling Cross cutting concerns and routing inside microservices using Spring Cloud Gateway 
8. Implementing Distributed tracing & Log aggregation in microservices using Spring Sleuth and Zipkin 
9. Monitoring microservices using Prometheus and Grafana 
10. Role of Docker in microservices and how to build docker images, containers 
11. Role of Docker compose and how to use it to run all the microservices inside a application 
12. Most commonly used Docker commands 
13. Role of Kubernetes in microservices as a container orchestration framework. 
14. How to setup a Kubernetes cluster inside GCP using GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) and deploy microservices inside it 
15. Most commonly used Kubernetes commands
